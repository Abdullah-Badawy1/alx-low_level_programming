# First Task in C - ALX Software Engineering Program

Welcome to the first task in the C programming language as part of the ALX Software Engineering Program. This task is designed to kickstart your journey into C programming, introducing you to basic output functions, the compilation process, and the GNU C Library (glibc).

## Resources

Before diving into coding, it's crucial to familiarize yourself with the following resources. They provide a solid foundation for understanding C programming:

- **Everything You Need to Know to Start with C.pdf**  
  Make sure to read this document thoroughly to get a good overview of C programming.

- **Dennis Ritchie**  
  Explore the works and contributions of Dennis Ritchie, the inventor of C.

- **"C" Programming Language: Brian Kernighan**  
  Learn about C from Brian Kernighan, co-author of the first book on C.

- **Why C Programming Is Awesome**  
  Understand the importance and enduring relevance of C programming.

- **Learning to Program in C Part 1 & Part 2**  
  These resources provide beginner-friendly introductions to programming in C.

- **Understanding C Program Compilation Process**  
  Grasp how C programs are compiled into executable code.

- **Betty Coding Style**  
  Learn about the official C coding style and how to ensure your code adheres to it.

- **Hash-bang under the hood**  
  Delve into this resource after you've gone through the others for deeper insights into system-level programming.

- **Linus Torvalds on C vs. C++**  
  Gain perspective on the C vs. C++ debate from Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux.

- **man or help:**  
  - `gcc`  
  - `printf (3)`  
  - `puts`  
  - `putchar`

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external help:

### General

- Why C programming is considered awesome.
- The history of C and its inventors, Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan.
- The contributions of Linus Torvalds to C programming.
- The process that occurs when you compile a C program using `gcc main.c`.
- The role of the entry point and the `main` function in C programs.
- How to output text to the console using `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar`.
- Using the unary operator `sizeof` to get the size of a specific type.
- Compiling programs with `gcc` and understanding the default program name when compiling.
- Adhering to the official C coding style and checking code with `betty-style`.
- Finding the appropriate header files for standard library functions.
- The impact of the `main` function on a program's return value.

## Introduction to `puts` and `putchar`

- `puts` function is used for writing a string to stdout, automatically appending a newline at the end.
- `putchar` function writes a single character to stdout.
- Both functions are part of the standard I/O library, essential for basic output in C programs.

## Understanding glibc

The GNU C Library (glibc) is a free, open-source implementation of the C standard library. It provides system call wrappers and basic facilities such as input/output operations, facilitating the development of GNU/Linux applications.
